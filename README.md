Glitch Loading Animation

This project features a dynamic loading animation with a glitch effect, floating emojis, and a fading subtitle, all set against a dark-themed background.

Features
- **Glitch Text Animation**: Creates a cyberpunk-style glitch effect on the loading text.
- **Floating Emojis**: Randomly positioned emojis move in a fluid motion for an engaging effect.
- **Subtitle Animation**: A subtitle fades in and out smoothly to complement the loading effect.
- **Dark Theme**: A sleek black background enhances the visual contrast.
